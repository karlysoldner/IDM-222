<p> GreenStemNetwork.org holds a collection of projects I worked on during my co-op at the Philadelphia Water Department in the Office of Watersheds</p>
<p> The data section includes soil moisture monitoring data of a six-site arduino-based network of green stormwater infrastructure sites that I helped create and maintain. I also assisted with social media and web content. Check out the B^3 and SIM projects since I was active in those as well!

    <h2>Digital Media Projects</h2>

    <p>Institutionalizing Delay: Foundation Funding and the Creation of U.S. Climate Change Counter-Movement Organizations</p>
    <p> Published in <i>Climactic Change</i> in 2013, this paper investigates the funding of the climate change denial movement. I was a researcher on the project, searching public documents for linkages between climate deniers, their foundations, and their corporate interests. </p>

    <p>This very website is a project is for Web-Authoring I. Making it responsive is my goal for Web-Authoring II. You can check out the struggle that was attempting to make it on my GitHub page.</p>
